# Snake Game
Welcome to the Snake Game!

## Objective
The objective of the game is to control the snake and guide it to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls or itself. The more food the snake eats, the longer it grows!

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.
- Eat the food to increase your score and the snake's length.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
